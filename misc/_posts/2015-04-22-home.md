In the Informatics for Design, Engineering And Learning (IDEAL) Lab, we study how to make **machines that learn how to design and build other machines**.
To do this, we use Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Crowdsourcing to understand how **large groups of people** design things and how **complex engineered systems** work, so that we can use the data they produce to make them better.

Some of the fundamental scientific questions we study include: What are efficient and useful ways to **computationally and mathematically represent designs**? How do we **combine physics-driven and data-driven models** to design better products? What makes **design collaboration** between large groups of people work well or poorly? How can we use tools from **applied mathematics** (such as graph theory, category theory, and statistics) and **computer science** (such as complexity theory, submodular optimization, and artificial intelligence) to better **understand how humans design?**

Some past practical applications of our research include: a fully automated system for inferring what makes designs creative given human feedback; the world's first polynomial time algorithm for diverse bi-partite b-matching; algorithms for exploring and optimizing high-dimensional design spaces (e.g., aircraft) that accelerate optimization by an order of magnitude or more; software for helping novices 3D print working mechanical devices; and network analyses of online collaborative design networks such as OpenIDEO.

Graduate and Post-Doctoral alumni from our lab have gone on to pursue productive research careers in Academia (MIT, American University), National Labs (NIH, NIST), and Industry (Siemens, Capital One, Amazon).
