Mark Fuge is an Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park, where he is also an affiliate faculty in the Institute for Systems Research and a member of the Maryland Robotics Center and Human-Computer Interaction Lab. His staff and students study fundamental scientific and mathematical questions behind how humans and computers can work together to design better complex engineered systems, from the molecular scale all the way to systems as large as aircraft and ships using tools from Computer Science (such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and submodular optimization) and Applied Mathematics (such as graph theory, category theory, and statistics). He received his Ph.D. from UC Berkeley and has received an NSF CAREER Award, a DARPA Young Faculty Award, and a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship. He gratefully acknowledges prior and current support from NSF, DARPA, ARPA-E, NIH, ONR, and Lockheed Martin, as well as the tireless efforts of his current and former graduate students and postdocs, upon whose coattails he has been graciously riding since 2015.
