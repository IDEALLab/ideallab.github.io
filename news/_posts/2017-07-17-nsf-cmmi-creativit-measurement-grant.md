Dr. Mark Fuge has been awarded an National Science Foundation grant from the CMMI [Engineering Systems and Design program](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=13340) for a project entitled ["Collaborative Research: Improving the Validity and Reliability of Creativity Ratings in Engineering Design"](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1728086&HistoricalAwards=false) in partnership with [Scarlett Miller](http://www.engr.psu.edu/britelab/scarlett.html) and [Sam Hunter](http://www.hunter.la.psu.edu/meet-the-lab/directory/sth11) from Penn State University. The grant builds upon our past work in [creativity measurement](/papers/paper/fuge-idetc-creativity-inference) and [statistics](/papers/paper/fuge-idetc-dtm-stats) by studying how to verify and validate different measurement scales for how to systematically measure creativity.
