Dr. Mark Fuge is leading a UMD team recently awarded a project as part of the DARPA Fundamentals of Design (FUN DESIGN) program for a project entitled "Learning to Move: From Operads to Fields to Functioning Topologies". The project explores how techniques from Category Theory, Reinforcement Learning, and Functional Programming can fundamentally re-think and automatically re-discover how conceptual design of mechanical systems works.
