Multiple postdoctoral positions are open in our lab to study fundamental mathematical and computational techniques for the conceptual design of engineered systems. Specifically, we are looking for talented researchers with expertise and a publication track-record in one (or more) of the following areas:

 * Design Theory and Methodology, for example, in Computational Design Synthesis for engineering systems involving the interplay of function, behavior, and structure.
 * Data-Driven Design and Optimization, for example, simulation-based design, multi-fidelity optimization, robotics, or optimal control.
 * Computer Science, for example, machine learning/AI, software architecture, functional programming, lambda-calculus, and computer graphics/geometry.
 * Applied Mathematics, for example, operator algebras, category theory, differential geometry, topology, or mathematical logic.
