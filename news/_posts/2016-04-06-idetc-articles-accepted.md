We’ll be presenting a paper at this year’s IDETC in the 42nd Design Automation Conference. The paper, entitled “How Designs Differ: Non-Linear Embeddings Illuminate Intrinsic Design Complexity”, shows how to measure the complexity and reduce the dimensionality of a geometric design space. Check out the paper on our [publications](/papers/) page.
