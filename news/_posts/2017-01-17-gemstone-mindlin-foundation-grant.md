[Team PRINT](http://teamprint.mybluemix.net/), an Undergraduate [Gemstone](http://www.gemstone.umd.edu/) research team advised by Dr. Mark Fuge, has been awarded a [Mindlin Foundation](https://mindlinfoundation.org/) grant for a project entitled "Stroke-based Symbolic Vocabulary Implementation in Computer Aided Design". The project studies how non-experts use symbols and gestures to identify common CAD operations with the goal of improving sketch-based CAD interfaces.
