Dr. Mark Fuge has been awarded a [DARPA Young Faculty Award](https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/for-universities/young-faculty-award) for a project entitled "Topology and Synthesis of Design Manifolds" as part of the "Functional Mathematical Tools for Design" topic area. The grant builds upon our [past work](/papers/paper/jmd-design-manifolds) in [Design Manifolds](/papers/paper/idetc-design-embedding) by studying how multiple part manifolds interact in assemblies and how mathematical tools from topology, group theory, and machine learning can aid human exploration of large, complex design spaces.
