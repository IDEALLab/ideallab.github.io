We'll be presenting two papers at this year's IDETC, both in the Design Theory and Methodology (DTM) track. One paper is on the evolution of the OpenIDEO design community, and another is on users research methods for Design for Development. Check out the papers on our [publications](/publications.html) page. We're looking forward to seeing everyone in Buffalo in August.
