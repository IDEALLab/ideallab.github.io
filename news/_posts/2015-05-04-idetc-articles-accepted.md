We'll be presenting a paper at this year's IDETC in the Design Theory and Methodology (DTM) track: DTM-7 Human Behavior in Design. The paper, entitled "A Scalpel not a Sword: On the Role of Statistical Tests in Design Cognition", explores how researchers in DTM use Null Hypothesis Statistical Testing in Design studies, and reviews some of the pitfalls associated with the practice. Check out the paper on our [publications](/publications.html) page. We're looking forward to seeing everyone in Boston in August!
