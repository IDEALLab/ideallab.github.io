Mark recently had to give a pre-recorded invited talk as part of a conference. We uploaded the video to [YouTube](https://youtu.be/g4JGVHnM-kw) in case others wanted to watch as well. Video is 18 minutes long and covers much of the work covered in [Wei Chen's dissertation](http://ideal.umd.edu/papers/phdthesis/chen-dissertation), including the following papers:
