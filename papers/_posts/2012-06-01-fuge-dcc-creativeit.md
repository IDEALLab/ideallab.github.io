# Abstract 

While there has been an active body of recent work in creativity tools and evaluation metrics for embodiment design, the scope of design extends beyond that of just embodiment, but also to that of service, business model, and experience design. Our hypothesis is that the same aspects of creativity measurement and stimulus that have been applied to embodiment design can be expanded to this larger realm of conceptual design, provided that they are adapted appropriately. We present some of our steps in this direction: 1) Meta4Explorer, a metaphor-based creativity stimulus tool that assists design teams in problem framing and concept generation, and 2) some initial results of a creativity evaluation metric for this domain, demonstrating the importance of user needs and product/service ecosystems in defining conceptual variety. We hope to use the workshop as a forum to discuss how existing creativity tools and evaluation mechanisms can be leveraged outside of typical engineering domains, addressing a broader area of conceptual design.
