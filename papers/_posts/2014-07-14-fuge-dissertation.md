# Abstract 

Both inside corporations and in self-organized online communities, globally distributed
groups of thousands of people now collaborate together on design projects
over the Internet. This changes the nature of product design, creating potential for
new levels of innovation and product development speed|for example, developing
vehicle designs in less than four months, or implementing new business models for
urban revitalization in less than a year. However, the plethora of information created
by these communities comes with a price: individuals cannot process all of it
in a reasonable time frame. Without a means of harnessing their collective efforts,
collaborative design communities can never reach their full potential as engines of design
innovation and development. To address this problem, this dissertation applies
techniques from data science and machine learning to answer to the following central
question:

How can online design communities effectively use the design data they
generate to help manage their operations and improve their designs?

Specifically, it presents examples around particular design communities (OpenIDEO
and HCD Connect), and some of the challenges they face: How do you maintain a
sustainable and creative design community without centralized command? How do
designers locate the most relevant or creative inspirations out of thousands of ideas?
How do novice designers use the community to learn what design methods are appropriate
for a given problem? How can you scaffold novice designers within a community
so that they can meaningfully contribute without requiring full expert knowledge? By
framing these real-world problems through the lens of Network Analysis, the Maximum
Coverage Problem, and Recommender Systems, this dissertation demonstrates
how modern machine learning techniques can ameliorate the issues community members
face in practice.
