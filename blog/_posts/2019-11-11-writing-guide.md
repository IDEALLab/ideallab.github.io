Scientific Writing: A Self-Study Guide
======================================

> Summary: I summarize some useful readings in Scientific Writing and Communication that helped me when I was learning to write and that will likely help my students and others.


Creating high-impact research requires effective writing. Most researchers, however, will never take a formal course in Scientific Writing. Even if we did, a formal course would hide the fact that researchers must continually practice and refine their writing craft over their careers. Since "good writers read about writing," this page lists a self-study course in scientific writing for the researcher who wants to become a better writer. It lists good books at the bottom of the page (all of which we have available in our lab's reading library), and then breaks out sections of those books for you to read and progress through: from understanding what scientific writing is to how to structure your writing to writing a first draft to editing and submitting the final copy and beyond. I hope that the below progression will guide you on your path to becoming a better writer and that you will add to and revise this list as you uncover what readings helped or hindered your progression as a writer.

**How to use this guide:** I organized this guide as a week-by-week progression of readings for the aspiring scientific writer. You will find some weeks more time-consuming than others. To help alleviate this burden, I have **bolded** specific titles that provide the best coverage in the least time each week. Allotting about 30 minutes, two to three times a week, should provide you ample time to finish the bolded ones. You can read the non-bolded chapters if you have extra time or are particularly interested in the topic. I suggest having some your own writing handy so that you can practice what you learn each week; working through your own concrete example improves both your learning and your research. While I arranged the topics in a week-by-week progression, that should not stop you from jumping around if your needs require it; skipping ahead to the "Editing" sections might be more useful when a deadline approaches.
